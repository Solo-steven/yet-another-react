# Yet-Another-React

this is repo still ongoing.

This repo is used to learn react source code, collect some resources from the community, and build some simple demos to simulate react behavior. The key feature that sets this repo apart from others is that I try to build react incrementally, each folder in the demo folder implements some of the react functionality. Concept from easy to difficult. This repo doesn't teach you to read React source code but tries to introduce the concept of React by examples.

### Prerequest

Most of the React source code is about traversing a Tree, make sure you are familiar with DFS algorithms (especially preorder-traversal) and you can solve some simple problems, here are some examples that should be easy for you to solve. Below are some examples of what you should address.
