# Yet-Another-React

this is repo still ongoing.

this repo is for learning react source code, collecting some resources found in the community, and building some simple demos to mock react behavior. The key feature that differentiates this repo from others is that I try to build react step by step, every folder in the demo folder would implement a part of react feature. from simple to hard concepts. Instead of teaching you to read react source code, this repo would try to introduce concepts in react with problem.

### Prerequest

Most of react source code are about traversal a Tree data structure, make sure you are familiar with the DFS Algorithm (preorder-traversal in particular), And you can solve some simple problems like tree-equal, tree-height ..etc. below is some example you should solve it easily. below is some example you should solve it.
